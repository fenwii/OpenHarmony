By signing this Agreement For Contribution \(this Agreement\), the undersigned Contributor agrees to accept and be legally bound by this Agreement. This Agreement applies to the Contribution submitted by Contributor to all the projects of OpenHarmony Community \(“Project”\), whether provided before, on or after the signing date.

**Contribution**  shall mean any work protectable under copyright lawthat is intentionally submitted by Contributor for inclusion in the software distributed by the Project. "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the hoster of the openEuler Community \(Hoster\) or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Hoster for the purpose of discussing and improving the Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by Me as "Not a Contribution."

**Contributor or I or Me or My**  shall mean the individual or legal entity identified in the signature block below. For legal entity, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, ‘control’ means direct or indirect ownership of at least fifty percent \(50%\) of the voting power, capital or other securities of controlled or commonly controlled entity.

Each Contributor hereby grants to the Hoster and the recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable copyright license to reproduce, use, modify, or distribute its Contribution, with modification or not.

In case the license adopted by the specific software distributed by the Project has further restriction on the patent license granted to the software recipients, for example, restricts the recipients to file patent litigation or enforcement against Contribution or such software, then the patent license to the recipients of the specific Project license prevails.
